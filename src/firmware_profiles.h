/*
 * Firmware profiles.
 *
 * Everything in the hook that depends on one particular build of the stock
 * Android Auto program (gal) is collected here. To support another firmware,
 * add one entry to k_profiles[] below; nothing else in the hook needs to know.
 *
 * How a profile is chosen
 *   The first three fields are the run-time addresses of three symbols that
 *   gal exports. They differ between builds, so together they identify the
 *   build. The hook resolves the symbols with dlsym and picks the entry whose
 *   three addresses all match. No match: the hook logs a fingerprint line with
 *   the three addresses it found and leaves Android Auto stock.
 *
 * The one value that cannot be looked up
 *   `ctor` is the address of gal's CVideoSinkCallbackHandler constructor. It is
 *   not exported, so it has to be found in the disassembly (tools/find_profile.py
 *   proposes it). Because calling a wrong address would crash gal, the hook
 *   also compares the first instruction word at that address with
 *   `ctor_first_word` before every use, and refuses on a mismatch.
 *
 * The remaining fields are object layouts inside gal. They were identical on
 * the builds seen so far, but they are per-profile so a build that differs can
 * be described without touching code. docs: docs/Development.md, "Adding a firmware"
 *
 * A profile must not be added on the strength of the tool's output alone. Check
 * each field against the disassembly, then test on a car with that firmware.
