# MIB Cluster Map

Puts your phone's map on the digital cluster of Volkswagen-group cars with a
Harman MIB2 / MIB2.5 High head unit ("Discover Pro").

| Phone | On the cluster | State |
|---|---|---|
| Android Auto | The Google Maps or Waze map, live | **Working** on VW `MHI2_ER_VWG13_P4521`, `K4525` and `P4512` (Golf R, Passat B8), SEAT `MHI2_ER_SEG11_P4708` and `P4709`, Skoda `MHI2_ER_SKG13_P4526`, Audi A4 B9 `MHI2_ER_AUG22_K3346`; US `P3662` with a trial line |
| Android Auto, on firmware without a map profile | Turn-by-turn arrows, distance and track ([adi961's jar](https://github.com/adi961/mib2-android-auto-vc), [our fork](https://github.com/MacsInSpace/mib2-android-auto-vc)) | Working on four trains, including SEAT `P4708`/`P4709` |
| Apple CarPlay | The Apple Maps or Google Maps map, live | **Working** on a Golf R (`P4512`), a SEAT (`P4709`) and a Golf (`K4525`). It can switch back to the car's own map while driving, under investigation (#19, #43). See [CarPlay](docs/CarPlay.md) |

It installs from an SD card as a software update. No toolbox, laptop or
command line is needed. The installer checks the unit and installs what fits
it: the map, the arrows, or nothing. If nothing fits, it collects the files
needed to add your unit and changes nothing.

No VNC and no app on the phone. The phone sends its own cluster video stream,
and the head unit passes it to the cluster the same way it sends the built-in
VW map.

> [!CAUTION]
> This modifies system files on the head unit. A mistake can leave the phone
> connection, or the whole centre screen, not starting. Use it only on a car
> you own, keep the SD card, keep the battery charged, and never install or
> test while driving. No warranty of any kind. Read
> [Safety and recovery](docs/Install.md#safety-and-recovery) first.

## Install

1. **Make the SD card.** Format a 2 to 32 GB card as FAT32. Download the zip
   from [Releases](../../releases) and copy everything inside it to the card:

   ```text
   (SD card)
   ├── ClusterMap/
   ├── Custom/
   ├── metainfo2.txt
   └── _Swdlautorun.txt
   ```

   Put it in **SD slot 1**, with the other slot empty.
2. **Run the update.** Engine running or a charger connected. Hold **MENU**
   until the service screen appears, then `Software updates/versions` >
   `Update` > the SD card > **`MIB Cluster Map`**. Let it finish (a
   "Version back documentation" screen at the end is normal: press
   `Cancel`), then hold the power button for ten seconds to reboot. Audi:
   the update menu is **BACK + upper-left** button and needs developer mode
   switched on in the head unit (5F). An autorun file on the card starts the
   update without the menu: tested on a VW, untested on Audi (see the
   [Install guide](docs/Install.md#route-1-software-update)).
3. **Use it.** Plug in the phone, start a map, and switch the cluster to its
   map view with the steering wheel buttons. iPhone: once after installing,
   **Forget This Car** in its CarPlay settings and plug it in again.

### Settings

You do not need to edit anything. In `ClusterMap/gal_dualscreen.conf` the
map's size (`GAL_SECONDARY_DPI`) and the area kept clear of the dials
(`GAL_SECONDARY_INSETS`) ship as `auto`. The installer reads which car it is
in and the size of the cockpit's map window, and uses the values owners have
tested on that car:

| Car | Cockpit map window | DPI | Insets (top, bottom, left, right) |
|---|---|---|---|
| SEAT | 1010×376 | 140 | `105,127,127,127` |
| Skoda | 1010×376 | 125 | `40,127,127,127` |
| VW | 800×480 | 138 | `52,82,127,127` |
| Any other | | 125 | `40,40,127,127` |

When owners of another car settle on values that work, they are added to
this list and arrive with the next release, so leave `auto` in place and
your car picks them up when you install it. To use your own values instead,
replace `auto` with numbers and install again; the installer keeps them.
The old 800×480 defaults are a good place to start:

```ini
GAL_SECONDARY_DPI=125
GAL_SECONDARY_INSETS=40,40,127,127
```

Lower DPI draws the map and its text smaller; raise an inset (0 to 127) if
something hides behind the dials.
`update_result.txt` says which values were used and where they came from.
Starting points from other owners are in the
[Install guide](docs/Install.md#settings-owners-have-settled-on).

The update writes what it did to `ClusterMap/update_result.txt` on the card.
It also adds a **ClusterMap** screen to the green engineering menu (hold MENU >
`Testmode` > `Green Developer Menu`) for status, logs, uninstall and the
turn-arrows switch.

The green menu and SSH routes, every setting, and recovery are in the
[Install guide](docs/Install.md).

**Uninstall:** green menu > `ClusterMap` > **Uninstall and restore original
state**, then reboot. Or, without the menu: on a computer, move
`UNINSTALL.txt` from the folder `to uninstall, move this file up one folder`
up into `ClusterMap`, and run the same update again.

## Which language should I write in?

Yours. Issues and comments in any language are welcome, and several cars now
working were debugged with people writing in their own. Logs and photos need
no translation at all. The same in nine languages:
[#36](https://github.com/MacsInSpace/mib-cluster-map/issues/36).

## Will it work on my car?

| Head unit | Firmware train starts | Today |
|---|---|---|
| VW Discover Pro 9.2 in (MIB2.5 High) | `MHI2_ER_VWG13_` | **Map** on `P4521` and `K4525` (software 1367), both road-tested, and `P4512` (Golf R; Passat B8, #47). US `P3662`: install with a trial line. `P4174` (#49) being ported. Others wanted |
| SEAT with the Harman unit | `MHI2_ER_SEG11_` | **Map** on `P4708` and `P4709` (1010×376 cluster window). **Arrows** on both |
| Skoda with the Harman unit | `MHI2_ER_SKG13_` | **Map** on `P4526`, car-confirmed (#15). Others wanted |
| VW Discover Pro 8 in (MIB2 High) | `MHI2_ER_VWG11_` | **Not developed further.** The hook supports this generation's older Android Auto receiver, and the map has shown on a `K3342` cockpit (#28), but keeping it up during a route needs NavActiveIgnore, which on this generation stopped Android Auto (#39) and froze the cockpit (#28). Testing on owners' cars has stopped so no unit is put at risk; the source and trial lines stay available for anyone who wants to continue on their own unit (#28, #39) |
| VW Discover Pro, Japan | `MHI2_JP_VW48x_` | **Trial** on `P0953` with a trial line (#37), being tested |
| Audi MIB2 High, Harman/Tegra | `MHI2_ER_AU` | **Map** on the A4 B9 `K3346` (#14; 1440×455 cockpit window, context 72, both set by the installer). A3 `AU37x` (#51) and an RS3 still to be tried. The update needs developer mode (see Install) |
| Audi MIB2 High, Qualcomm | `MHI2Q_` | Not this project: see [kamgurgul/mib2q-carplay](https://github.com/kamgurgul/mib2q-carplay) |
| MIB2 Standard (Composition, Discover Media) | `MST2_` | No. A different unit; nothing here applies |

You need a digital cluster (Active Info Display) for the map. The train is on
the green menu **Status** screen; "Software: 1367" under `Setup` > `System
information` is a hint, not proof. You do not have to work it out: the
installer checks the real firmware itself.

Not listed, or "wanted"? Run the update anyway: it installs nothing and
collects what is needed to add your unit. See
[Getting your unit added](docs/Install.md#getting-your-unit-added).

## Status

Experimental. Developed on a VW Golf 7.5 (`P4521`) and tested on a Tiguan (`P4521`),
a Passat and an Arteon (`K4525`), two SEATs (`P4708`, `P4709`), a Skoda (`P4526`),
a Golf R and a Passat B8 (`P4512`). The Android Auto map runs at about 30 frames
per second, with and without a route, and comes back by itself after the
phone is unplugged and plugged in again.

| Part | State |
|---|---|
| Android Auto map, installer and uninstaller over SSH | Tested on cars (Golf `P4521`, SEAT `P4708`) |
| Software update and green menu routes | Tested on cars (Golf `P4521`, Golf R `P4512`) |
| Hardware video decoding (`GAL_PLAYER_DECODER=hw`, off by default) | Fails on the car and falls back to software decoding; under investigation |
| CarPlay map | Shown on a car (Golf R, iPhone over USB) after a firewall fix; layout between the dials under test |
| Long drives, reverse camera, waking from sleep | Road-tested on `K4525`; otherwise little testing |
| Autorun install without the service menu (`Swdlautorun.txt`) | Tested on a car (Golf `P4521`); Audi untested |

Showing the arrows and the map together works on SEAT with
`CLUSTERMAP_KEEP_ARROWS=1`. On VW leave it at 0: the map has gone blank when
a route starts, and on a Golf (`P4521`) the cockpit switched to its own arrow
view after a few presses of OK and stayed there, even after a restart, until
the arrows were removed. One Tiguan (`K4525`) reports both working (#44). The
turn pictograms need `GAL_DUALSCREEN_AAP_MINOR` at 5 or lower, the shipped
value from v1.1.1-beta9 (#4). Not possible so far: zooming the cluster map from the steering
wheel ([why](docs/Development.md#zoom)), and switching between the phone's map
and the car's map from the steering wheel.
