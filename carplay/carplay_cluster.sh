# CarPlay map on the cluster: runs stream-player while CarPlay sends its
# cluster video, and stops it when CarPlay stops.
#
#   carplay_cluster.sh <dio_manager pid>
#
# Started by libcarplay_cluster.so when dio_manager (CarPlay) starts; ends
# when that dio_manager does. harman-f's libaltscreen111.so, in the same
# process, receives CarPlay's cluster stream and serves it as H.264 on
# 127.0.0.1:19820, at the cluster map window's size (set by the installer).
# While it does, it writes "streaming" to its state file.
# The player draws that stream on the cluster exactly as it draws Android
# Auto's, and on SIGTERM gives the cluster back to the stock map.
# expr is in /mnt/app/armle/usr/bin on this unit (Golf R log: "expr: cannot execute").
