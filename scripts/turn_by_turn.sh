# The turn-by-turn arrows jar (adi961's VCAndroidAuto.jar) and the cluster map
# cannot both be active: with the jar loaded, the cluster goes blank when a
# route starts. This script switches the jar on and off through lsd_jar.sh.
#
#   turn_by_turn.sh remove    take its line out (done by the map installer)
#   turn_by_turn.sh restore   put it back, only if "remove" took it out
#   turn_by_turn.sh install   copy the bundled jar if needed and add its line
#   turn_by_turn.sh uninstall take it out again, only if "install" added it
#
# Reboot afterwards.
