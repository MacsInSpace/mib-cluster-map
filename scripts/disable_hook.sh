# Track whether the route restore actually happened. These are
# best-effort by design (the config restore above is the part that
# matters, and it is already done), but reporting success when dmdt
# never ran would be actively misleading during a real recovery -- an
# observed failure mode: without LD_LIBRARY_PATH set, dmdt dies with
# "ldd:FATAL: Could not load library libdmdt_core.so" and this block
# silently did nothing while still printing success.
# The VC's display id for dmdt sc/sb is 4, NOT the 1 that `dmdt gs`
# prints as its index. dmdt accepts the wrong id and does nothing, so a
# restore issued with 1 leaves the cockpit wherever the test left it --
# during a real recovery, which is the worst time to find out.
# Confirmed by VcMOSTRenderMqb's stream player (dc 70 3 / sc 4 70,
# restoring with dc 70 33 / sc 4 70) and by on-car notes.
# Those are VW/SEAT/Skoda numbers; a car whose settings name another
# cockpit context (Audi, #14) is restored with its own.
